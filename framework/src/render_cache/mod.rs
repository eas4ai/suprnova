//! Suprnova's RenderCache: route and group policy, one global middleware
//! that serves proven Complete representations, a request-scoped dependency
//! collector, database-authoritative generations, and Tier 0 providers.
//!
//! Live is complete without it. Enabling it changes avoided work, never
//! application capability.
//!
//! This module starts small: Task 9 added configuration, route and group
//! policy registration, and effective policy resolution. Task 10 (this
//! one) adds the request-scoped dependency collector. The remaining
//! submodules (the file store, the ledger, the Live integration, the
//! middleware, migrations, and the ORM entities) are added by later tasks
//! in the same iteration.
